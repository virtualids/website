	<p>Systems Atlanta, the company who designs real world ids5, describes it as "an electronic binder, providing immediate access to a wide range of operational information and support data, while also promoting the safety and efficiency of operations. Compared to other IDS products, IDS5 is not just a weather and document viewer but is also a true collaboration tool"</p>
